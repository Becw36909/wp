This directory is for a test in week 14

This file is for "non-code" written answers in week 14

**I understand that the putcsv function will write to the file any names with spaces will have double quotes - without suitable time for a workaround, I have only tested using names with one word - so in essence, they are not 'full names' as such. Time was the limiting factor in doing more about this to cater for full names and not just first/one name.
